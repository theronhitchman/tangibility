# This is a .sage file for generating graphics.
# Output should be a "wire frame" for the boundary of a piece of helicoid,
# suitable for dipping in a soap solution.

# first set up basics we will use throughout: variables and an empty plot object
%var r theta
P = plot()



# Create central axis


# Create Helicoidal boundary edge



# Create Boundary lines, bottom, then top


# add spheres to the corners




# plot the result


# export to obj file
